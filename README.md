# Monthly Calendar with Reminders

## Project Overview

This project is a simple Python-based desktop application that displays a monthly calendar and allows users to set and manage reminders for specific dates. The application is built using the tkinter library, which provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for easy interaction. Users can navigate through different months, set reminders for any day, and view these reminders within the calendar.

## Features

- Monthly Calendar Display: The calendar shows the days of the current month, with options to navigate between months.
- Reminder Management: Users can set reminders for specific days. Days with reminders are highlighted in yellow on the calendar.
- User-Friendly Interface: The application uses a simple and intuitive interface, making it easy to use even for beginners.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter: For creating the graphical user interface.
- Datetime: For managing and manipulating date and time information.
- Calendar: For generating calendar data.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x: Ensure that Python 3.x is installed on your system.

## Installation
No additional installation steps are required, as tkinter comes pre-installed with Python. Simply download the project files to your local machine.

## Running the Application

1. Run the Application:

```sh
python calendar_app.py

2. The application window will open, displaying the current monthâ€™s calendar.
3. Use the < and > buttons to navigate between months.
4. Click on any day to set a reminder. The day will be highlighted in yellow if a reminder is set.

## Results

The application successfully allows users to:

- View a monthly calendar for any year and month.
- Set and manage reminders for specific days.
- Easily navigate between months using the provided navigation buttons.
- Users can see their reminders highlighted in yellow, providing a quick visual reference for days with scheduled tasks or events.

Example Usage
- Setting a Reminder: Clicking on a day in the calendar prompts the user to enter a reminder. This reminder is then stored and associated with that specific date.
- Viewing Reminders: Days with reminders are highlighted, allowing users to quickly identify important dates.
  
## Conclusion

The Monthly Calendar with Reminders project is a practical tool for basic scheduling and date management. It provides a user-friendly interface that makes it easy to keep track of important dates and events. While it is a simple application, it can be expanded with additional features such as persistent storage, reminder notifications, and more sophisticated calendar views.

This project demonstrates the use of Python's tkinter for GUI development and basic date management using Python's datetime and calendar libraries. It serves as a solid foundation for more complex calendar and reminder applications.
